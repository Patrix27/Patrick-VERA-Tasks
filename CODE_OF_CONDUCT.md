# Open Leadership Map Whitepaper Participation Guidelines

## Code of Conduct

As contributors to the Mozilla Privacy Arcade project, we agree to review and abide by the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).

## Participation Guidelines

Moreover, to promote a safe space for all, we agree to:

- Bring our best selves to the work and assume best intentions from others.
- Respect one another’s space online and off.
- Work intentionally to make this project a safe and inviting space for all contributors and for contributors from all backgrounds.
- Refrain from all destructive, harassing, negative, threatening and otherwise harmful behavior. 
- Report conduct issues to the project lead in a timely fashion.
- Abide by the project lead's decisions about conduct issues or use direct, but non-harmful ways to question and improve them.
- Support community members victimized by harmful interactions.

To work together in an open and efficient way, we also commit to:

- Work as openly as possible with due respect for others' privacy choices and sense of agency.
- Follow the 50/50 rule: for each issue a person raises or for each problem a person identifies, they try to propose a solution, as well.
- Follow the Nth rule: we will try to “speak” or comment only 1/Nth of the time to allow others to speak, where N is the total number of active contributors on the project.
- Avoid using jargon and ask for clarification when we need it.
- Provide feedback in a timely way when invited to do so.
